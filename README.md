  <h1>ML Models from Scratch</h1>

  <p>This repository contains a collection of machine learning models implemented from scratch using Python.</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>The purpose of this project is to provide implementations of popular machine learning models without relying on external libraries or frameworks. By implementing these models from scratch, you can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms and concepts.</p>

  <h2>Models</h2>

  <p>The repository currently includes the following machine learning models:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Linear Regression</li>
    <li>Logistic Regression</li>
    <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</li>
    <li>K-Means Clustering</li>
    <li>Decision Trees</li>
    <li>Random Forests</li>
    <li>Gradient Boosting</li>
    <li>Neural Networks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Usage</h2>

  <p>You can clone this repository and explore the code for each model individually. Each model is implemented in a separate Python file, along with a corresponding example or demonstration.</p>

  <h2>Contributing</h2>

  <p>Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you would like to add a new model, improve existing code, or fix any issues, please submit a pull request.</p>
